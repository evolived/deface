#How to get and use the demonstration code

# Introduction #

The download section contains a zip with the code necessary to build the deface demo program.

# Details #

In addition to the demo zip, there are a couple of other libraries used in the demo code.  These are ASWing and ImageProcessing.  Links to come soon.

# Basics #

Download the demo zip and unzip it into a directory.  The zip includes a FlashDevelop project file to help you set up the project.  You will also need ASWing and ImageProcessing for this demo to compile.  Set up FlashDevelop (or your IDE of choice) to include these on the classpath before compiling.  Main.as should be the main/document class when you compile.

Have fun!
